This extension treats certain buffers as \"popup\" buffers and displays

You can control which buffers are treated as popup buffers by changing
the variables `purpose-x-popwin-major-modes',
`purpose-x-popwin-buffer-names' and
`purpose-x-popwin-buffer-name-regexps'.
Look at `purpose-x-popwin-*' variables and functions to learn more.

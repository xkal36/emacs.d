## My Emacs Config
This is my emacs configuration tree. It is here
mainly so that I can quickly get my environment up and
running on a new machine, but feel free to also use it!

## Installation
To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.

init-packages.el automatically installs packages that need to be installed, showing
them in a buffer which when finished can be killed with
the usual <kbd>C-x</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd>.

## Dependencies
See https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy for a full list of the dependencies.

## Custom Keybindings
The various custom keybindings can be found in init-keybindings.el.

## Custom Functions
These can be found in init-functions.el.

## Color Theme
The color theme used is the cyberpunk theme. I have changed it a good bit
though. These changes along with various other general customisations can be seen in custom.el.
